It would be interesting to explore if any of these features is a good predictor of a language's orthographic rules. It would also be interesting to apply the artificial token approach to other problems besides multilingual g2p. One closely related application is monolingual English g2p.

For a target word in the corpus, we scan through all of its contexts.

The word polarity scores are computed using (DISPLAY_FORM4). Here, we obtain those scores from the training data.

However, studies on sentence segmentation, which is sometimes called sentence boundary detection, are still found in the speech recognition field BIBREF25 . The typical input to speech recognition model is simply a stream of words. If two sentences are spoken back to back, by default, a recognition engine will treat it as one sentence. Thus, sentence boundary detection is also considered a punctuation restoration task in speech recognition because when the model attempts to restores the period in the text, the sentence boundary position will also be defined.

The latter allows one to identify words that are representatives for a document category, and eventually to detect potential dataset biases or classifier specific drawbacks.

Besides, an additional component, named attention, exists in between, deciding which parts of the input sequence the decoder should pay attention in order to choose which to output next. In other words, this attention component calculates the context relevant to the decision of the decoder at the considering time.

Variational inference–based dropout locks the dropout mask used for the recurrent connections across timesteps, so a single RNN pass uses a single stochastic subset of the recurrent weights. Zoneout stochastically chooses a new subset of channels to “zone out” at each timestep; for these channels the network copies states from one timestep to the next without modification. As QRNNs lack recurrent weights, the variational inference approach does not apply. Thus we extended zoneout to the QRNN architecture by modifying the pooling function to keep the previous pooling state for a stochastic subset of channels. Conveniently, this is equivalent to stochastically setting a subset of the QRNN's INLINEFORM0 gate channels to 1, or applying dropout on INLINEFORM1 : DISPLAYFORM0   Thus the pooling function itself need not be modified at all.

First, there is the effect of the embedding learning algorithm. These algorithms differ in many aspects, including in sensitivity to word order (e.g., SENNA: yes, word2vec: no), in objective function and in their treatment of ambiguity (explicitly modeled only by huang2012improving. Second, there is the effect of the corpus. We would expect the size and genre of the corpus to have a big effect even though we did not analyze this effect in this paper. Third, complementarity of word embeddings is likely to be more useful for some tasks than for others. Sentiment is a good application for complementary word embeddings because solving this task requires drawing on heterogeneous sources of information, including syntax, semantics and genre as well as the core polarity of a word. Other tasks like part of speech (POS) tagging may benefit less from",

Each of kanji characters can be loosely considered as a subword that we mentioned in the previous section. In the meanwhile, each of hiragana or katakana characters can be considered as a latin character in English or Vietnamese. In addition, there is no space in the Japanese written texts to separate the characters, either kanji, ,hiragana or katakana. So we cannot learn good subwords from a small corpus by directly applying BPE or the variant VNBPE on Japanese written texts. In order to learn good subwords and with a little knowledge about Japanese, we decided to use KyTea BIBREF10 to do Japanese word segmentation and then apply Sennrich's BPE on those word-segmented texts.

In terms of this, rather than starting from Twitter API Search, we look into the archived snapshots of two major news websites (CNN, NBC), and then extract the tweet blocks that are embedded in the news articles. In order to get enough data, we first extract the URLs of all section pages (e.g. World, Politics, Money, Tech) from the snapshot of each home page and then crawl all articles with tweets from these section pages.

Likewise, the content relevant to the query but not representative of documents will be excluded either. As a result, in an isolated model, weights for neither query-dependent nor query-independent features could be learned well from reference summaries.

That is, we concatenate the reduced forms (SVD - U) of corpus-based, dictionary-based, and the whole of 4-score vectors of each word, horizontally. Accordingly, each corpus word is represented by a 404-dimensional vector, since corpus-based and dictionary-based vector components are each composed of 200 dimensions, whereas the 4-score vector component is formed by four values. The main intuition behind the ensemble method is that some approaches compensate for what the others may lack. For example, the corpus-based approach captures the domain-specific, semantic, and syntactic characteristics. On the other hand, the 4-scores method captures supervised features, and the dictionary-based approach is helpful in capturing the general semantic characteristics.

The group showcased how this generative model could learn to artificially replicate data patterns to an unprecedented realistic degree [5]. Since then, these models have shown tremendous potential in their ability to generate photo-realistic images and coherent text samples [5]. The framework that GANs use for generating new data points employs an end-to-end neural network comprised of two models: a generator and a discriminator [5]. The generator is tasked with replicating the data that is fed into the model, without ever being directly exposed to the real samples. Instead, this model learns to reproduce the general patterns of the input via its interaction with the discriminator. The role of the discriminator, in turn, is to",

These will vary depending on the type of text, the date at which the `original' was produced, and the nature of the font and typesetting.

To do this, we introduce a new representation of textual data which more adequately captures dynamics of human language, namely unsupervised learned word embeddings. In the broader natural language processing (NLP) literature, there has been a surge of research devoted to the development of distributional representations of speech which retain syntactical language qualities in ways that the bag-of-words (BOW) approach typically used in political text analysis research is not equipped to retain. The hypothesis claims that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings BIBREF12 .

The goal is to “attract” synonyms closer to each other in the transformed vector space as they reflect true semantic similarity, and “repel” antonyms further apart. In the second step, the linguistic constraints are translated from English to the target language via a shared cross-lingual word vector space. To this end, following Ponti:2019emnlp we rely on cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWEs) BIBREF146 available online, which are based on Wiki ft vectors. Following that, a constraint refinement step is applied in the target language which aims to eliminate the noise inserted during the translation process. This is done by training a relation classification tool: it is trained again on the English linguistic constraints and then used on the translated target language constraints, where the transfer is again enabled via a shared cross-lingual"

This interest is motivated by the desire to move away from simple counts and weights of words, towards representations which can preserve word context and linguistic features of human speech. Studies find that these approaches are not only intuitively desirable, but also increase classification accuracy in machine learning tasks. Vector space approaches involve the embedding of document features from one dimension per word space to a continuous, lower dimensional vector space. Each document feature is represented as a real-valued vector and it has been shown that these representations retain desirable syntactical qualities, such as context and structure of speech.

            "Abstract\nAs deep neural networks continue to revolutionize various application domains, there is increasing interest in making these powerful models more understandable and interpretable, and narrowing down the causes of good and bad predictions. We focus on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), state of the art models in speech recognition and translation. Our approach to increasing interpretability is by combining an RNN with a hidden Markov model (HMM), a simpler and more transparent model. We explore various combinations of RNNs and HMMs: an HMM trained on LSTM states; a hybrid model where an HMM is trained first, then a small LSTM is given HMM state distributions and trained to fill in gaps in the HMM's performance; and a jointly trained hybrid model. We find that the LSTM and HMM learn complementary information about the features in the text.",
            "Collectively, the success of large pretrained neural models, both encoder-only BERT-like architectures as well as encoder–decoder architectures like T5, raise interesting questions for the pursuit of commonsense reasoning. Researchers have discovered that previous models perform well on benchmark datasets because they pick up on incidental biases in the dataset that have nothing to do with the task; in contrast, the WinoGrande dataset has devoted considerable effort to reducing such biases, which may allow models to (inadvertently) “cheat” (for example, using simple statistical associations). While it is certainly true that datasets over-estimate the commonsense reasoning capabilities of modern models BIBREF1, there are alternative and complementary explanations as well: It has been a fundamental assumption of the research community that commonsense reasoning is difficult because it comprises tacit rather than explicit knowledge BIBREF8. That is, commonsense knowledge—like water is",

In 2014, Ian Goodfellow et. al proposed the general adversarial network (GAN) [5]. The group showcased how this generative model could learn to artificially replicate data patterns to an unprecedented realistic degree [5]. Since then, these models have shown tremendous potential in their ability to generate photo-realistic images and coherent text samples [5]. The framework that GANs use for generating new data points employs an end-to-end neural network comprised of two models: a generator and a discriminator [5]. The generator is tasked with replicating the data that is fed into the model, without ever being directly exposed to the real samples. Instead, this model learns to reproduce the general patterns of the input via its interaction with the discriminator. The role of the discriminator, in turn, is to",

Furthermore, interpretable models make it easier to find spurious features, to do error analysis, and to support interpretation of results.

Instead, the output of each decoder QRNN layer's convolution functions is supplemented at every timestep with the final encoder hidden state.

Recently proposed methods for open vocabulary semantic parsing overcome this limitation by learning execution models for arbitrary language, essentially using a text corpus as a kind of knowledge base. However, all prior approaches to open vocabulary semantic parsing replace a formal KB with textual information, making no use of the KB in their models.

When encoding a current sentence in a story context, the model can attend not only to the words in the preceding sentence, but also the knowledge graphs which are retrieved from ConceptNet for each word. In this manner, commonsense knowledge can be encoded in the model through graph representation techniques, and therefore, be used to facilitate understanding story context and inferring coherent endings.

            "Named Entity Recognition (NER), or alternatively Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC), is the task of detecting entities in an input text and to assign them to a specific class. It starts to be defined in the early '80, and over the years several approaches have been proposed BIBREF2 . Early systems were based on handcrafted rule-based algorithms, while recently several contributions by Machine Learning scientists have helped in integrating probabilistic models into NER systems. In particular, new developments in neural architectures have become an important resource for this task. Their main advantages are that they do not need language-specific knowledge resources BIBREF3 , and they are robust to the noisy and short nature of social media messages BIBREF4 . Indeed, according to a performance analysis of several Named Entity Recognition and Linking systems presented in BIBREF5 , it has been found that poor capitalization is one of the main issues when dealing with",
            "Experiments\nWe evaluate the performance of the QRNN on three different natural language tasks: document-level sentiment classification, language modeling, and character-based neural machine translation. Our QRNN models outperform LSTM-based models of equal hidden size on all three tasks while dramatically improving computation speed. Experiments were implemented in Chainer BIBREF16 ."
