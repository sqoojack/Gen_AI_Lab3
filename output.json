        "title": "Semi-supervised Thai Sentence Segmentation Using Local and Distant Word Representations",
        "answer": "They utilize unlabeled data to improve model representations by incorporating it into the training process, which leads to a slight improvement in the F1 score from 88.8% to 88.9% on the UGWC dataset. This indicates that the unlabeled data provides additional information that helps refine the model's performance. However, it's worth noting that the improvement is minimal, and the model's performance is still heavily reliant on the labeled data. The lack of significant improvement may be due to the limited availability of unlabeled data in the Orchid dataset, as mentioned in Section UID33. This suggests that while unlabeled data can\n\nUse the following context to answer the question.\nlocal and distant representations, are mainly described in this subsection.
